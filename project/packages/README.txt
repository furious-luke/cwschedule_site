Place any additional packages you would like installed
inside the provided files, based on which service is
used to host the package. Place each package on its
own line. For example, to install the github package
"furious-luke/django-utils", inside "github.txt" you
would add the line:

  furious-luke/django-utils

Note that the owner of the package must also be specified
for hosts that require it.
